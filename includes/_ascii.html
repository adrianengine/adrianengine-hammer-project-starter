  If you are viewing the source, clearly you're my kind of person.
  With this giant ascii art embedded in every page of this site,
  I would like to share with you a piece of developer wisdom:

  “Good performance is good design, and performance should be
  a priority from start rather than afterthought saved for
  developers to handle.”
